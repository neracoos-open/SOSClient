There is only one modules: jquery.parseSOSGetObs.js which requires the jQuery javascript library

These are aimed at the SOS servers being developed by the NOAA / IOOS program  http://www.ioos.gov/.
There is support for the new 2012 IOOS SOS CDM Discrete Observation Profiles, based on SOS1/.0 and SWE10.
It also maintains support for OOSTethys SWE1.0 type responses.
===========

Documenentation files and examples are included.
Open test.html in browser to get started.
Examples of the new SOS Profile xml files are also included in the xml subdir.
test.html must be installed on a web server in order to load the xml examples.

Requirements:  jQuery 1.7.1 http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js
jQuery 1.7 dropped support for find("[nodeName='xxx:element_name']") so a new plugin function was defined.
filterNode('xxx:element_name')
XML processing performance was greatly enhanced.
